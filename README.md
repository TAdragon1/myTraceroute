# Project 2

## Targets

My `distMeasurement.py` looks for hostnames in the `targets.txt` file.

My targets per HW2 instructions are: sohu.com, 1688.com, jiameng.com, wikimedia.org,
mit.edu, skroutz.gr, nownews.com, ih5.cn, t-online.de, and rbc.ru

Each of sohu.com, 1688.com, wikimedia.org, mit.edu, skroutz.gr, and rbc.ru did not respond.

jiameng.com resolved to an ip address of 127.0.0.1, with a hop count of 0, and RTT of 0.450. But I thought I should replace it with a site with not local host ip address.

I am keeping nownews.com, ih5.cn, and t-online.de, and am replacing the other seven with sites from the top 1000.

The new 7 sites are: 360.cn, twitter.com, envato.com, softonic.com, blogspot.com, yahoo.com, and google.com

## Results

With the graph created from my results there is a clear visualization of a longer RTT with more hops. My report is in `EECS 325 Project 2.pdf`
